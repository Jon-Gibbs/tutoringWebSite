        <p className = 'main-text'> 
        I do not believe there is any such thing as “one size fits all tutoring”. My tutoring adapts to the needs, personality, and goals of the student. However, there are some features of a session that stay constant. A student will usually bring the classwork that they are struggling with to the session so that we can work on it together. The purpose of this is to give help that is relevant to the challenges the student is facing, and build confidence for when they return to the classroom. If there are any past subjects the student is struggling with, those can also be handled within the session. Meetings with students take place wherever is most comfortable, but meeting in public spaces is preferred. Things such as session frequency, length, and structure are entirely flexible to what best serves the student.

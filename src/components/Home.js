        Hello! My name is Jon Gibbs, a University of Washgington Computer Science student and private math tutor based in the greater Lynwood area. I got my start as a tutor by working in my collegeâ€™s math help center, where I discovered my passion for helping students achieve their academic goals. With two years and hundreds of hours of one-on-one tutoring experience, I specialize in all math subjects up to the pre-calculus level, excluding geometry. My goal in private tutoring is to continue aiding students in their academic journey, and open doors to their future success.
